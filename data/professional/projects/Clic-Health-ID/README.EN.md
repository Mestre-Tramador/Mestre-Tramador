**[Return][back]**

Clic Health ID was a project built using Laravel for backend and Angular for frontend, containerized
in Docker both for development and production environment. It was a secure and robust software where
medics, specifically gerontologists, would fill a form with information from their patients and the
system would then calculate the best preventive approach for each case. This "calculator" would consider
even tiny decimal differences between every time the form was filled.

The data was stored in a MySQL instance modelled to also include other relevant data for both the medic
and the patient, like scheduling of appointments and history of resources used in the system. Finally,
this system provided a fully customizable interface, being it changeable to fit any company logo and
colors using it.

To this day, it seems that Clic Health ID as now just Health ID and is focused on blood collection and
testing. I can't provide any useful information about the business and/or technology of the system
at the current state due to me not being working with it anymore. If you want to access either way,
it can be done by this site: <https://www.clichealthid.com>
