Mingoo (stylized as mingoo) was built using PHP mixed HTML, CSS and JavaScript without any particular
framework. The project consists in an e-commerce of audio-guided tours, where you can login as a tourist
and/or as a guide to buy and/or create the aforementioned tours. There was also an administration
specific page to manage the users and configure prices and or the content of the tours, as some may
misguide the tourist.

All the data of the project was stored in a MySQL instance locally, either in development or production
environment, and friendly routing was done using NGINX's rewriting capabilities. All this configuration
worked as a PWA too, being able to be installed on mobile devices without the usage of Google Play and
App Store.

Nowadays the project were remade and is now under a new interface and tech stacks. I can't provide any
information about it due to me not working on it, yet the e-commerce can be accessed by the same URL:
