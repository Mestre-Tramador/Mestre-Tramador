T4 Vistorias (same as its company) is a mobile app built with plain React Native and some customization
directly in the Android (Java) and iOS (Objective-C) integrations. The app would create PDF reports based
on photos taken on the properties being inspected, and these photos could also be edited to include arrows,
circles and other signs indicating the found problems or avaries. All data and photos are stored offline
on the phone, yet they can be synchronized with a server to persist on a database.

This server runs a simple Express application that served as endpoint to the mobile app. It was focused
on synchronization of the data, and a strong connection to a local MySQL instance to store all of it,
including the files binaries.

The app is available in all mobile stores and is being maintained, yet not by me, so I can't give
any more information regarding it. To know more about T4 Vistorias, you can access this site: <https://www.t4vistorias.com.br>
