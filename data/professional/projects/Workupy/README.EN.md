Workupy is a no-code platform where you can build any website, system and/or mobile application you want
to. A big monolithic application with Express for backend and React for frontend, it was rebuilt into
micro-services and containerized with Docker, using algo auxiliar containers running NGINX instances
for networking resolving. All data is currently store into multiple databases in MySQL, and some data
is also cached into a Redis database, also serving as a queue processor.

The system is currently online and open to few testers. If you want to know more about it in its current
version, check this site: <https://workupy.com>
