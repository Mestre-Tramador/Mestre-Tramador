**[Return][back]**

PlugWays (to differ from "Plugways", the name of the company) was a cross-platform mobile app built
with the Ionic framework, using iframes to access pure PHP pages on a server that also had logic mixed
with HTML, CSS and JS. The general purpose of the app was tracking, so users can track each others by
"bounding" themselves, or using a specific fleet configuration where drivers were tracked. This configuration
would allow the drivers to link their apps with specific GPS devices that emitted signals in specific
protocols and were decoded by the backend.

Among other functionalities of the app, there was video call, chat, dashboard and reports, and finally
a simple fleet management. All the data was stored in a single MySQL instance database, sharing the
data both for the app and the general backend.

The app is not available at the App Store and the Play Store anymore, and all the servers were shutdown
due to commercial reasons.
