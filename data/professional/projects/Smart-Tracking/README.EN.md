Smart Tracking is the first project from Brazilian company Smart Tour and was a pioneer on the tracking
of individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, thus even being awarded by World Health Organization.
It is built using Express for backend and Angular for frontend, it focused mainly into giving Brazilian
city governments a tool to track its inhabitants during the period by a dashboard showing data of who
scanned QR Codes all around the same city. Stores, buses, buildings, everything could have a QR Code,
and some even offered benefits for scanning and contributing to the data pool of the system.

All data was stored in a MySQL instance, and it was mainly immutable. Also, the system did crossing
of the data, and some exports were allowed, yet no more actions were available, which meant that the
cities would choose the best approach to see infection focuses and how to treat them.

The project has ended its service and cannot be accessed as the server was shutdown, but if you want
