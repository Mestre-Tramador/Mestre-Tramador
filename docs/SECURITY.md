# Security Policy

**Read also in: [Español], [Português Brasileiro]**

I will always try my best to deliver secure and reliable code without any exceptions.
Also, few of my repositories would really require sensitive and real data from the
users, but, if they by chance need, it will be the minimum.

For detailed instructions on what to do about reporting security issues, check the
exact repository you want to. Further questions, please contact me directly.
