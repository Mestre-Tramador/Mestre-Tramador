# DOCUMENTATION

This folder stores most of the Community Standard files that I use on my repositories,
with slightly adaptations in some. Below is a full explanation of each one.

**Read it also in:** **[Español], [Português Brasileiro]**

## CHANGELOG

After I read about the [Keep a Changelog] standards, I immediately added it to
my repositories, in order to improve the coverage of my code. I like the below
quote from the official site:

> \[...] Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software are human beings
> who care about what's in the software. When the software changes, people want
> to know why and how.

## CODE OF CONDUCT

In terms of Open Source community, nothings stands as high as a Code of Conduct,
specially because it states a welcoming place to work and outlines that people (me
and others) are aware of misbehavior. There is many Codes of Conducts to use, but
I did prefer the **[Contributor Covenant]**, not because it is well known, but also
because, as [they][Contributor Covenant FAQ] say:

> **Doesn’t this code of conduct just promote political correctness?**
> Only if you define political correctness as the belief that women, non-binary
> people, gay, lesbian, queer, and/or transgender people, people of color, and
> people of different religious backgrounds should be afforded the same rights
> and privileges as everyone else.

## CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

The soul of the Open Source is contribution. But, as we handle with human relations,
it is wise to define some guidelines on how to contribute according to the repository
needs. I generally write my own Contribution Guidelines, specifying about testing,
Pull Requests and Issues (except Security related, please read [below][SECURITY POLICY]).

## LICENSING

A Software License is a perfect law instrument nowadays, either by enforcing copyright
or copyleft. After I read and learned about plenty of licenses, I choose the following
as my main:

- [GNU General Public License v3.0][GNU GPLv3] for software projects;
- [Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International][CC BY-SA 4.0] for
  assets projects;

**Other projects of mine may have other licenses, but they are a minority*.

## SECURITY POLICY

Even if we are working with a License and a Code of Conduct, Security is still a
delicate topic and even GitHub advices to treat it separately. Because of that,
policies are created to guarantee security on the source, and also show what to do
about any kind of problem involving it. I generally write my own Security Policies,
but many have similar procedures, considering my repositories does not fetch any
sensitive data.

## GITHUB

GitHub has some specific files to improve Issues and Pull Request, templates to
make it easier to do such actions. More about it [here][GitHub Templates].

I currently use, for Issue Templates, the following types:

- Feature Request;
- Bug Report;
- Docs Revision;
- Question Answer;
- Message.

The usage of them vary on the repository.

**I currently did not implemented any Pull Request Templates*.

GitHub also offers the [GitHub Pages] service, basically allowing to create static
pages for the repositories. I'm currently working on my first in [this][CV] repository.
