# Contribution Guidelines

I must thank you for wanting to contribute in this repository, at least firstly!
Now, considering how little are the changes to be made here, I've listed below
the ways you can contribute to my personal profile:

- **[Documentation Revision]**
- **[Chatting]**
- **[Pull Requests]**
- **[Other Contributions]**

## Documentation Revision

If you find some error on the files, like misspelling of words or newer versions
of files like the Code of Conduct, please submit a Docs Revision issue. You can
do it directly on the Issues tab or by clicking [here][Docs Revision].

## Chatting

Maybe there is a private thing you wanna ask or something you want to tell me, either
way, I always welcome a brother or a sister of code in a conversation! You can,
of course, check my social media [here][Social Media].

## Pull Requests

By firsthand: **Currently all Pull Requests are going to be reject on this repository**.
The motive is simple, I'm researching and doing some tests on how to implement
the Github's Pull Requests Templates. After that, I'll allow only PRs that change
files on the `docs/` folder.

## Other Contributions

Other than the aforementioned contributions, you can contribute to my work going
to my other repositories and seeking further on this subject. There is not much
more to be done here, as far as I know...
