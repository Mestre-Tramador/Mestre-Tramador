# Contribution Guidelines

I must thank you for wanting to contribute in this repository, at least firstly! Well, now taking into
the account that you're taking your time to contribute to my personal profile files, there are a few
ways to do this, even if for small changes, which you can check below:

## Documentation Revision

This is a pure documentation repository, sometimes misspells can happen or some copy-pasted documents
were updated, anything like that would inquire a revision. With that in mind, I consolidated the GitHub
Issue for that, which you can submit by clicking [here][issue]. Take in mind that I use also [this][.github]
repository to hold some of the more "community" files, so please submit an issue there if must.

## Pull Requests

By firsthand: **Currently all pull requests are going to be reject on this repository**.
The motive is simple, I'm researching and doing some tests on how to implement
the GitHub's Pull Requests Templates. After that, I'll allow only PRs that change
files on the `docs/` folder.
